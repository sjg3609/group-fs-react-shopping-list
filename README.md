# React Shopping List

## Description

Duration: 2 Weeks

In this project we used React.js, Node.js, Express, Axios and Postico to create a User Inputted Shopping list. This allowed the User to create a list of items and then mark them as Purchased or clear the items after they had purchased them from the list. Using the input fields in "Add an Item" it allows the user to add the item, the quanity of the item and then if needed, units of the item to be purchased. After that data is inputted, it moves down the page into a Shopping List that will display the items, quantity and units to buy or remove from the list. Addtionally, there are two buttons that can be used on the page that will reset the shopping list if any item has been marked as purchased and to clear the items from the list entirely all at once, rather than one at a time.
